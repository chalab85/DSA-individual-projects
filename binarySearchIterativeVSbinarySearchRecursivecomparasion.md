##Time Complexity
Both iterative and recursive implementations of Binary Search operate with a time complexity of O(log n). This is because the algorithm repeatedly divides the search space by half until the target element is found or the search space becomes empty.

In Iterative Binary Search, the algorithm uses a loop to perform these divisions. Each iteration eliminates half of the remaining elements, leading to logarithmic time complexity.

In Recursive Binary Search, the function calls itself for smaller subarrays until the base condition is met (i.e., the target is found or the search space is empty). The time complexity remains O(log n) since the size of the search space reduces exponentially with each recursive call.

##Space Complexity
Space complexity differs significantly between the two approaches:

Iterative Binary Search has a space complexity of O(1) because it doesn't require additional memory apart from a few loop variables. The entire computation is performed within a single function call, making it memory-efficient.

Recursive Binary Search has a space complexity of O(log n) due to the function call stack. Each recursive call adds a new frame to the stack, and since there are logarithmic recursive calls, the space usage grows accordingly. While the difference might be negligible for small input sizes, the recursive approach can become problematic for very large arrays, potentially leading to a stack overflow.

##Usability and Practicality
##Iterative Approach:

This approach is often preferred in scenarios where memory usage is a critical concern.

It is also safer for large datasets because it avoids the risk of stack overflow that can occur in the recursive approach.

However, iterative solutions can sometimes be more verbose and less intuitive to write than recursive ones.

Recursive Approach:

Recursion is often more elegant and easier to implement for problems like Binary Search, as it directly translates the divide-and-conquer strategy into code.

Recursive Binary Search is particularly useful for educational purposes, helping to understand the concept of recursion and problem decomposition.

##Summary of Findings
Both iterative and recursive approaches are equally efficient in terms of time complexity (O(log n)). However, the iterative approach is more memory-efficient due to its constant space usage, while the recursive approach has a more intuitive structure but consumes additional space due to the call stack. For larger datasets or applications where memory constraints are critical, the iterative approach is generally preferred. In cases where simplicity and readability are prioritized, the recursive approach can be a good choice.
