Algorithm:

# 1.Initialize three variables: first, second, and third to INT_MIN.

   Traverse the array and compare each element:

        Update first if the current element is larger than the current largest value.

        Update second and third in subsequent comparisons.

Print the second and third largest elements at the end.
